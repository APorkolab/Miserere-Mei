## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Secure Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords
- **HTTPS Only**: Always access via HTTPS in production
- **Regular Backups**: Maintain secure backups of game data
- **Monitor Logs**: Review application logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers

- **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused review
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication/authorization
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control

## 🔍 Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **🔐 Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure tokens
- **🛡️ Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **🚫 Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all endpoints
- **🔒 Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- **📋 Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers via Helmet.js
- **🌐 CORS Protection**: Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **⚡ Rate Limiting**: Request throttling to prevent abuse
- **📊 Audit Logging**: Security events logging and monitoring
- **🐳 Container Security**: Non-root containers with minimal attack surface

### Automated Security Scanning

- **🔍 Dependency Scanning**: OWASP dependency vulnerability checks
- **📝 Code Analysis**: ESLint security rules enforcement
- **🚨 Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic security checks before commits
- **🔄 CI/CD Security**: Automated security scans in pipeline
- **📊 SonarCloud Integration**: Static code security analysis

## 🚫 Security Vulnerabilities We've Fixed

### Version 1.0.3 (Current)

- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries implemented
- **XSS Prevention**: Output encoding and CSP headers
- **Authentication Bypass**: JWT token validation strengthened
- **Directory Traversal**: Path sanitization implemented

### Version 1.0.2

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Updated all packages with known CVEs
- **Session Fixation**: Proper session management implemented
- **CSRF Protection**: Anti-CSRF tokens added

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Client-Side Game State**: Some game state stored client-side (low risk)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation (could be enhanced)
3. **File Upload**: Not implemented (reduces attack surface)
4. **API Versioning**: Single version (breaking changes could affect security)

### Planned Security Enhancements

- **🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication**: 2FA support
- **🛡️ Advanced Rate Limiting**: IP-based and user-based limits
- **📊 Security Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and alerting
- **🔍 Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **🚨 Incident Response**: Automated incident detection and response

## 🔧 Security Configuration
